---------------------------- Redux Slice -------------------

1. In store all the states are here we are seperating those states as slice for efficient use.

2. creating Slice is easy import CreateSlice function from redux.

3.set initial state of the Slice as object

4. export 

createsSlice = createsSlice({
    name : 'Slice',
    initialState,
    redcers:{
        logic1 : (logic) =>{} ,
        logicN : (logicN) =>{}
    }
});

5. Export the reducer logic inside the Created slice.

6. Export reducer

export {logic1 , logicN } = CreateSlice.actions;
export default createsSlice.reducer ;

---------------------- Using Slices in App component ------------------

1.Import the created slice in the store. in store reducer set the created slice as property. also 
  Import slice reducer function to dispathc in our app.

2. in slice component import useSelector , useDispatch from react redux. it used to select
   particular value from the created slice. dispatch is used to dispatch the reducer function

const state = useSelector((state) => state.sliceName.state);
const dispach = useDispatch;

3. actions.payload gives the data of the performed actions.
