----------------------------- REDUX CREATE ASYNC THUNK ------------------

1.createAsyncThunk --> help us to handle the state of the async and promises handling in redux.
   before using the createAsyncThunk create intitial state as object. status and error props.

2. It take three params type string , callback functions , options. It gives us a threee state of 
   the promises Fulfilled | Pending | Rejected.

3.We need to create a reducer logic for createAsyncThunk().
  extraReducers is a reducer logic for createAsyncThunk . it take builder param. builder is an object.
  
  extraReducers(builder){
    builder.addCase(promise.state , (state,action)=>{

    }) --> adding the case for each promises state. what to do in that state.
  };   --> action holds the response data from the server.

4. export all variables to use in our application. 

5. unwrap() --> unwraps the async thunk promises to used to find and show the error.

6.const sampleThunk = createAsyncThunk('sample/thunk' , async => (data) {
  const response = await axios.get(url);
  return response.data;
})  it gives only promises. we need to handle the promise state
