----------------------------------- REUCX CREATE SELECTOR --------------

1. it a memoization for redux to enhance perfomance. it works like react memoization.

2. createSelector(['prewritten reducer functions'] , (function return data) => ('performs some operations'));

3. it take input as function that we created. and take function as parameter,  based on param
it prform some operations.

4. useSelector(state , createSelector function(params)); performs some operations base on the writte

logic inside the createSelector function.

5. it will be used in two slices are communicated.

MEMOZIATION --> it like cacheing the result if the same results will generated it dont run the code. send the cached data. it run only the differnt results are generated.

------------------------------- React MEMO -----------------

1. component = React.memo(componentFunction);

2.in the above case the react memo will work when the component props are changed.

----------------------------------- NORMALIZATION IN REDUX --------------------

1.Noramization in  redux is structuring the redux state data.

2.It uses Their id for normalizing the state data. it also provide CRUD operations functions by default.

3.CreateEntityAdapter() --> it s NORMALIZATION function for Redux. It only performed on normalixed data.

4.It maps the data by their id , Entities are the id mapped data.

Example : 
{
    id: [1,2,3],
    name : 'dummy'
} --> mapped ID

{
    {
        id:1,
        data : 'dummy'
    }
    {
        id:2,
        data : 'dummy'
    }
} --> Entity
